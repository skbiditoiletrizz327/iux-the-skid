This post reveals the truth about Iux, someone who claims to be skilled in development but has repeatedly shown himself to be nothing more than a **skid** (someone who uses others' work without credit) and a **scammer**. Despite his self-promotion, Iux has contributed little to projects and instead capitalized on the efforts of others—most notably Seth’s work on Legion. Below is the irrefutable proof.

### 1. Asking to Obfuscate a Basic Webhook Logger Script
One of the clearest signs of Iux's lack of skills: he once asked how to obfuscate a simple webhook logger script. This was during the time Legion was logging people, and it's laughable that someone involved in such projects needed help with something so basic.

### 2. Fear of Conflict with Seth Over Source Release
When I was planning to release the source code for Legion, Iux panicked and urged me to remove specific features like "Sex, Control," etc. His reasoning? He didn't want to get into "beef" with Seth, which clearly shows how dependent he was on Seth's work.

### 3. Ignorance of Basic Networking: Localhost Confusion
Iux displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of basic networking concepts. He claimed that a script (like skido.lua) could use an API to send requests via "localhost." However, it's technically impossible for a Lua script in an executor sandbox to connect to the internet through localhost. The term **"local"** means it’s limited to the device itself, making external connections impossible without additional steps.

### 4. Scamming and Dodging Responsibility Using "Vouches"
Iux has a history of scamming people, often brushing off his actions by citing his "vouches" in the Stando community. He even once said, "One guy can do nothing; I have vouches in Stando," as if that somehow absolves him from wrongdoing.

### 5. Asking for Help with Basic Scripts
Despite his claims of expertise, Iux repeatedly asked for help with simple scripts. From basic window tracking to a Discord bot that sends messages, his constant requests for assistance exposed his lack of knowledge.

- **Window tracking script**: Iux asked me for help because Kingy wouldn’t send him the script.

- **Discord bot**: Iux even asked me to create a basic bot that outputs a message.

### 6. Inappropriate Requests: A "Rape Script"
In a particularly disturbing request, Iux asked **ImmortalityLord** to make a "rape script" for him. This is not only inappropriate but also highlights his complete lack of ethical boundaries.

### 7. ImmortalityLord's Experience with Iux
Even **ImmortalityLord** can attest to Iux's incompetence and unethical behavior. Below is an example of a conversation where he experienced similar issues with Iux.

### Conclusion
The evidence is overwhelming: Iux is nothing more than a skid and a scammer who relies on others' work while profiting from it. His incompetence and unethical behavior have been exposed time and time again. Let this be a warning to anyone thinking of working with him.
