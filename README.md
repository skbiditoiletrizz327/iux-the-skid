# Exposing Iux: The Skid & Scammer
### Why Iux is a Skid: Despite his claims, Iux never actually worked on Legion. Instead, he used Seth's scripts and profited off of them. Here's the proof.

- ## [+] First point: Asking if you can obfuscate a fucking webhook logger script  (This was when Legion was Logging people after the release and iux asked if you can obfuscated a simple script LMAO)

- ## Saying when I was planning on releasing the source that I should remove Sex,Control and so on because he would get beef with **Seth**

- ## Saying that the "skido.lua" "stand" uses a api for sending reuqests now and then saying LOCALHOST is crazy. (I am not defending skido.lua)
Just so you know its not possible (trough a lua script in a executor sandbox) to host on their own. They have to launch e.g a websocket (on their pc) before that to connect to that. And since its only local you CAN'T connect to it trough the internet. It's not possible its literally in the name _**"local"**_

- ## Scamming people and then using "I have vouches in Stando" as a excuse to get away with it
And I quote "One guy can do nothing, I have vouches in Stando"
